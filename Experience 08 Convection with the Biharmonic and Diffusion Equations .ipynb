    "\n",
    "When gradients are not very steep (for example for thermally driven convection), a  convenient and not memory and computing demanding algorithm is possible. Let us look now at how a less accurate but much faster, less memory consuming and always balanced approach can be written and simply vectorized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most well-known algorithm is called the *Upwind scheme* and is based on the simple idea that every total derivative respect to space of a field of a moving fluid can be expressed as the product of the velocity field for the gradient of the field itself:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{d F}{d t} = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial x_i}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x_i} = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial t} + v_i \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x_i}\n",
    "\\end{equation}  \n",
    "\n",
    "The terms on the right to the Eulerian derivative are given by the product of the velocity multiplied to the gradient. This simple technique is very old and was already introduced by Courant and co-workers in 1965. Its stability is also defined by the so called Courant criterium $v \\delta t / \\Delta x < 1$. While the advantage of this approach is clearly speed and minimized memory usage (compared to using particles, for example) it is subjected to quite a substantial diffusion of sharp gradients, which makes its use inappropriate for accurate tracking of material boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "A modern version of this algorithm is the so-called \\emph{Donor-Cell algorithm}. Its goal is the same, but it is based on fluxes, therefore its physical interpretation is more clear. When the material flows from left to\n",
    "right ($v_x>0$), then the flux of the field $F$ through the interface between one cell and the next is $F_{leftCell} \\dot v_x^{left} - F_{Cell} \\dot v_x^{right}$, while if $v_x<0$ the flux is $F_{Cell} \\dot v_x^{right} - F_{rightCell} \\dot v_x^{left}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To vectorize the donor-cell method the simplest approach is to calculate the flux through the each cell and then use a boolean index and its negative (not index) to select which direction for the flow needs to be taken. This is done for every axis separately. It follows here an example in 2D.    \n"
