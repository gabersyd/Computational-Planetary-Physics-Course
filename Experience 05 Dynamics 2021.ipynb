    "It is introduced here the concept of force and shown how Newtonian problems, meaning that can be solved from the equation $F=ma$, can be discretized and solved using the Finite Difference method. Applications are (i) the addition of the air Drag to the gravity force on a falling rain drop; (ii) the trajectory of lapils from an explosive volcano, and (iii) the rotation of a Gyroscope (as well as the Earth). For all these systems the Kinematic, Potential and Dissipated energies are calculated. It is shown how by monitoring their values it is possible to assess the correctness of the numerical result and to find the smallest departure from the exact solution."

In fact few factors make rain such an innocuous phenomena. One of them is the friction of the air. What would happen if the air would not slow rain? In this case the only force driving the rain drop would be the force of gravity.
